## Description
The "Pet Name Generator" is a fun, button-based web application that helps users generate unique names for their pets. The process is interactive: users click on an animal's name, which generates additional buttons representing various characteristics of the animal. The application then uses the selected characteristics to create a personalized and unique pet name.

## Features
- Choose an animal from a list of buttons (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`).
- After selecting an animal, a set of characteristic buttons appears (e.g., `Hyperactive`, `Clingy`, `Lazy`...).
- The final pet name is generated based on the selected characteristics.

## How It Works
1. Animal Selection: The user starts by clicking on an animal button (e.g., `Dog`).
2. Select Characteristics: After choosing an animal, new buttons representing different characteristics (`Hyperactive`, `Clingy`, `Lazy`...) appear.
3. Name Generation: The app generates a custom pet name based on the selected animal and its characteristics.

- It is also possible to discard names that were saved by selecting the `x` underneath each name
- You can choose the button `Clear All Pet Names` to remove all saved pet names from storage and start over

2. Click on an animal button to start.
3. After the animal is selected, a set of characteristic buttons will appear.
