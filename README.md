# Project-1
Bootcamp Group Project 1

Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past four modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Use a CSS framework (see suggestions).
Include at least one modal instead of native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality. Look into the CSS framework's documentation for more information!
Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
Be responsive.
Have a polished UI.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
