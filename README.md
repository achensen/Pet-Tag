# Project Name Pet Name Generator

## Description
The "Pet Name Generator" is a fun, button-based web application that helps users generate unique names for their pets. The process is interactive: users click on an animal's name, which generates additional buttons representing various characteristics of the animal. The application then uses the selected characteristics to create a personalized and unique pet name.

## Features
- Choose an animal from a list of buttons (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird).
- After selecting an animal, a set of characteristic buttons appears (e.g., Hyperactive, Clingy, Lazy...).
- The final pet name is generated based on the selected characteristics.

## How It Works
1. Animal Selection: The user starts by clicking on an animal button (e.g., "Dog").
2. Select Characteristics: After choosing an animal, new buttons representing different characteristics (Hyperactive, Clingy, Lazy...). appear.
3. Name Generation: The app generates a custom pet name based on the selected animal and its characteristics.

## Example
1. Click the Dog button.
2. New buttons like (Hyperactive, Clingy, Lazy...). appear. appear.
3. Click Hyperactive ...
4. The new pet name will be generated. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS for styling buttons and layout.
- JavaScript for handling button clicks and generating pet names dynamically.


## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Click on an animal button to start.
3. After the animal is selected, a set of characteristic buttons will appear.
4. Click on any characteristic buttons )to choose traits for your pet.
5. A unique name for your pet will be generated and displayed.

## Customization

You can easily customize the application by:

- Adding more animals by updating the `animals` array in the JavaScript file.
- Modifying or adding characteristics for each animal.
- Styling the buttons and layout in the CSS file to suit your preferences.





# Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past four modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Use a CSS framework (see suggestions).
Include at least one modal instead of native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality. Look into the CSS framework's documentation for more information!
Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
Be responsive.
Have a polished UI.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
